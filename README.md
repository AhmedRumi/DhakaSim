# DhakaSim

DhakaSim is a specialized, event-based microscopic simulator designed to capture the non-lane-based and heterogeneous traffic common in cities of developing countries like Dhaka, Bangladesh. It models Dhaka’s uniquely chaotic road conditions—such as parked vehicles encroaching on limited road space, disorganized roadside activities, heavy pedestrian flow, and a substantial share of non-motorized traffic—all of which contribute to severe congestion. We collect extensive real-world traffic data  and integrate them into the simulator’s car-following and lane-changing models. We deisgn non-lane-based traffic by allowing vehicles in DhakaSim occupy multiple “strips” rather than single lanes. Its validation against sources such as Google Maps travel-time data shows DhakaSim’s ability to reproduce realistic congestion patterns, making it a valuable tool for planning interventions, experimenting with potential traffic management strategies, and studying how different side-friction factors impact overall traffic flow.
